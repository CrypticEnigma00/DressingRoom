Version 0.11.0 (2024/03/17)
* The "Always change page on zone change" setting has been reworded to "Return
  to default page if there is no zone match" to better describe what it
  actually does, and its behavior has been changed so that it will return only
  if the current page was not manually selected

Version 0.10.1 (2022/08/26)
* Display a warning to users if the saved variables are in the format used by
  the newer "Stonethorn" variant of Dressing Room
  - Note: Users of the newer "Stonethorn" variant should not install this
    "2018" variant

Version 0.10.0 (2022/08/26)

  variants of this addon

Version 0.9.0 (2018/03/19)
* Dressing Room now supports multiple pages, thanks to code contributed by
  @Toloache
  - New pages by default will bear the name of the zone that you are currently
    in, and can be renamed by clicking on the name
  - If you enter a new zone whose name matches that of one of your pages,
    Dressing Room will automatically switch to that page; this behavior can be
    disabled in the settings
